abstract = "In this paper, we present a bilingual question answering system, BQAS that can generate questions and provide their answers from electronic Bangla and English documents. The system first performs the analysis of the contents of the documents to generate questions based on user provided query. It then generates answers of the questions. The system has been evaluated with real documents. We have found that our system can generate questions and related answers up to a satisfactory level from the documents of two different languages as well as from the documents of the same language."
